# SecureRollout notes

This doc is for my own reference, therefore not polished. Its a running log of design decisions and reasoning that I am updating as I build.

----

# Core Principle: Fail-Closed, Not Fail-Open
If the security check (analysis-runner/Trivy/Kyverno/Rekor) errors, times out or is unreachable, the default action is to **block promotion**, never let it through. A gate that fails open creates false confidence, which is worse than no gate.

# Session 1 (Kind Cluster, Argo Rollouts, AnalysisTemplate)

## What was done
- 3-node Kind Cluster (1 control plane and 2 workers) via `config.yml'
- Argo Rollouts controller + CRD installed in `argo-rollouts` namespace
- Sample `Rollout` object (`demo-rollout`) with canary steps
- Mock security check service (`hashicorp/http-echo`) simulating a pass/fail HTTP endpoint
- `AnalysisTemplate` (`mock-security-check`) using the **web-provider** polling the mock service

##Notes
1) Kind's fault-isolation limitation
 - Kind(Kubernetes in Docker) nodes are Docker containers sharing one Ubuntu kernel/CPU/RAM/disk, not separate machines. This means that:
    - It is good for testing control-plane logic, Rollout/AnalysisRun behavior, scheduling scheduling
    - but it cannot test true node-level fault isolation, a resource spike on one "node" can bleed into others as they share the same physical infra.
### Key concept: AnalysisTemplate / AnalysisRun mechanics (Web provider)
- `AnalysisTemplate` = reusable check definition. `AnalysisRun` = live instance, created when a Rollout hits an `analysis` step.
- Web provider: HTTP GET → parse JSON response via `jsonPath` → extract value into `result` → evaluate `successCondition` / `failureCondition` against it.
- This is the exact pattern analysis-runner will use — its `/check` endpoint response will be evaluated the same way, just backed by real Trivy/Kyverno/Rekor calls instead of a fixed mock value.
- Verified hands-on: real rollback triggered automatically when mock returned `"fail"` — no manual intervention. Old ReplicaSet's AnalysisRun showed `✔ Successful ✔ 3`; failing one showed `✖ Failed ✖ 1` (failed fast on first bad sample, didn't wait for remaining retries).

### Key design decision: Error vs Failed, and consecutiveErrorLimit
Argo Rollouts treats metric results as **three** states: `Successful`, `Failed`, `Error` (not just pass/fail). An unreachable endpoint / timeout / malformed response is `Error`, not automatically `Failed`.

- `consecutiveErrorLimit` (default: 4) — how many consecutive errors are tolerated before the metric is finally marked failed.
- Verified hands-on: deleted the mock Service mid-rollout → took **5** consecutive DNS-lookup failures before Argo Rollouts gave up: `"Metric assessed Error due to consecutiveErrors (5) > consecutiveErrorLimit (4)"`.
- **Why this matters for fail-closed**: Error and Failed must both result in blocked promotion / rollback — an attacker or outage causing analysis-runner to be unreachable must never be a *safer* path to promotion than an explicit fail.
- **The real risk isn't "canary sneaks past 100%"** — analysis steps block further promotion by default. The real risk is **exposure time**: traffic already being served at the current step's weight remains live and unverified for the entire duration it takes the check to resolve to a failure. Fail-closed blocks *further* promotion; it does not retroactively protect users already routed to canary pods during the uncertain window.
- **Design goal:** minimize total exposure time = `interval × consecutiveErrorLimit` (plus samples required for a genuine pass), balanced against dependency response times (Trivy/Kyverno/Rekor realistically ~10-15s) and tolerance for transient blips vs genuine outages.
- **Chosen starting values (to validate against real dependency latency in Month 2):**
  - `interval: 15s` — close to realistic Trivy/Kyverno/Rekor combined response time, without polling faster than they can respond
  - `consecutiveErrorLimit: 2` — tolerate exactly one transient blip, not two in a row
  - `count: 2` — require at least 2 genuine passing samples before trusting a result, not just 1
  - Worst-case exposure window before reacting to an error: ~30s. Revisit once real dependency latency is measured.

---

## Open questions / things to revisit
- [ ] Validate `interval`/`consecutiveErrorLimit`/`count` against actual Trivy/Kyverno/Rekor response times once analysis-runner exists
- [ ] Design analysis-runner's `/check` API contract (request/response schema)

## Session 2 — Analysis-runner request/response schema design, AnalysisTemplate args wiring

### Request schema (reasoned from first principles)
- `image_digest` — not tag. Tags are mutable pointers; a registry can silently swap what a tag points to (STRIDE tampering risk already identified). Digest is a cryptographic hash of exact content — pins to what CI actually scanned/signed. Used by both Trivy (scan target) and cosign/Rekor (verify target) — no redundant fields needed.
- `namespace` + `pod_template_hash` — NOT individual pod name (pods are ephemeral, get recreated with new names even within one revision). `rollouts-pod-template-hash` label is what Kubernetes/Argo Rollouts itself generates per-revision, stable across pod restarts within that revision. Checking one representative pod per revision is sufficient — pod specs within a revision are identical by construction (same template), so checking all 5 replicas would be redundant.

### Response schema (reasoned from first principles)
- `overall_status`: "pass"/"fail" — the ONLY field Argo Rollouts' Web provider reads via jsonPath
- `checked_digest` — echo back what was actually checked, guards against request/response mismatch bugs
- `checks: { trivy, kyverno, cosign }` — each always present (pass or fail, not just on failure — passing evidence matters too, e.g. for the "killer demo clip" and for audit trails), each with `status` + `reason` (not just pass/fail — a bare boolean gives zero triage starting point for on-call at 2am; different failing checks need completely different response playbooks)

### Argo Rollouts args-passing mechanism (learned hands-on)
- AnalysisTemplate must explicitly declare every arg it expects under `spec.args` — referencing `{{args.x}}` in metrics config without declaring `x` in `spec.args` fails with "failed to resolve {{args.x}}". This was the actual root cause of an hour+ debugging session — don't skip this declaration.
- Rollout supplies actual values when referencing the template, via three mechanisms:
  - `value: "..."` — static value (used for image-digest; real value would come from CI/GitOps pipeline writing it in the same commit as the image field, since digest isn't otherwise inferable from a running cluster object)
  - `valueFrom.fieldRef.fieldPath: metadata.namespace` — reads a field off the Rollout object itself
  - `valueFrom.podTemplateHashValue: Latest` (or `Stable`) — built-in convenience, resolves to the actual rollouts-pod-template-hash of the new (or old) ReplicaSet, no manual lookup needed

### Debugging notes (real bugs hit, worth remembering)
1. YAML key typo: `template:` vs `templates:` (plural) under an inline analysis step — caught by Kubernetes' strict decoding, failed loudly rather than silently misbehaving.
2. Argo Rollouts only runs canary steps (including inline analysis) when a genuine Stable-vs-Latest ReplicaSet distinction exists — the very first deploy to a Rollout skips steps entirely since there's nothing to canary against. `podTemplateHashValue: Latest` can't resolve without this distinction existing.
3. A rollout stuck in `Degraded`/aborted state needs an explicit `kubectl argo rollouts retry` before it'll accept further updates — a plain spec change isn't enough to unstick it.
4. Root cause of the persistent "failed to resolve {{args.pod-hash}}" error across multiple restructuring attempts: the AnalysisTemplate was missing its `spec.args` declaration block entirely (dropped during earlier live `kubectl edit` sessions). Lesson: prefer editing the source YAML file and re-applying over repeated `kubectl edit` on live objects — live edits don't automatically sync back to the file, so the file and cluster state can silently diverge.

## Session 3 — analysis-runner: Trivy + Kyverno integration (Go)

### Go fundamentals learned hands-on
- `package main` / `func main()`, Go modules (`go mod init`)
- Structs + JSON struct tags for typed request/response handling
- `os/exec` for shelling out to CLI tools (trivy, kubectl) — args passed as a slice, not a shell string, which avoids shell-injection risk since `image_digest` is externally supplied input
- Explicit `err != nil` checking as Go's core idiom — a natural fit for fail-closed design, since every failure point must be explicitly handled, nothing propagates silently
- `bytes.Buffer` + `cmd.Stdout`/`cmd.Stderr` to capture full command output including stderr (capturing only stdout initially lost the actual error reason — "exit status 1" vs the real "unable to find the specified image" message)
- `fmt.Errorf("...: %v", err)` to wrap errors with context rather than replacing them

### Trivy integration
- `exec.Command("trivy", "image", "--format", "json", ...)`, parse into structs matching Trivy's real JSON schema (`Results[].Vulnerabilities[]`, fields: `VulnerabilityID`, `Severity`, `PkgName`)
- Threshold: any single CRITICAL finding fails the whole check (strict, matches consecutiveErrorLimit=1-style fail-fast pattern elsewhere in the project; may want configurable per-environment later)
- Verified real scan against `argoproj/rollouts-demo:blue`: 5 CRITICAL, 53 HIGH — all in `stdlib` (image built with outdated Go compiler, not app-code bugs — a reminder that "vulnerable" doesn't always mean "insecure code written")
- Verified fail-closed path: nonexistent image → Trivy exits non-zero → captured via stderr → clear, specific error surfaced, not a silent pass

### Kyverno integration
- **Design point**: Kyverno's normal mode is *admission-time* blocking; project needs *re-check of already-running* pods at canary-check time → used `background: true` scanning mode instead, which continuously evaluates existing resources and writes `PolicyReport` objects queryable anytime
- **`validationFailureAction: Audit`**, not `Enforce` — deliberate: don't want Kyverno independently blocking pod creation at the K8s API level as a second, uncoordinated enforcement point outside analysis-runner's designed flow
- **Real bug caught**: initial policy used `=(runAsNonRoot): true` (conditional anchor) — this means "IF present, validate; if absent, skip (counts as pass)" — backwards from what's needed. Every pod showed 100% pass despite none setting the field, because the check was being silently skipped, not satisfied. Fixed by removing the anchor (bare field requires presence + match). **Lesson: a security policy that only checks *when a field happens to be set* can produce a false "all clear" that looks identical to genuine compliance — worth double-checking any policy's actual enforcement, not just its pass/fail dashboard.**
- **PolicyReport → Pod matching**: initially guessed at a `kyverno.io/resource.name` label (wrong — didn't exist). Correct mechanism: standard Kubernetes `ownerReferences` field on the PolicyReport object, linking back to the exact Pod (`kind: Pod`, `name: <pod-name>`) — a first-class K8s mechanism, not Kyverno-specific.
- Currently shells out to `kubectl` for both pod lookup and PolicyReport fetch (matches existing os/exec pattern) — noted as a deliberate simplification; a native Kubernetes Go client library is the more idiomatic long-term approach, planned as a future refactor.

### Open design question — error handling change
Changed Trivy's hard-error path: instead of returning HTTP 500 immediately (which would abort the whole request and never report Kyverno's result), an internal tool failure now surfaces as an explicit `checks.trivy.status: "fail"` within a normal 200 response. Tradeoff: keeps full checks breakdown visible for debugging even when one sub-check errors, but means Argo Rollouts' `Error`/`consecutiveErrorLimit` mechanism now only triggers when analysis-runner itself is completely unreachable — an internal tool failure (Trivy crashes, Kyverno unreachable) surfaces as a clean "fail" rather than an "Error" state. Need to decide if this is actually the desired behavior, or if certain internal failures (e.g., Trivy DB completely corrupted vs. a single scan failing) should still propagate as a hard error.


## Session 4 — cosign/Rekor integration; all three checks complete

### cosign integration
- Signed a real image (`securerollout-demo:blue`, pushed to own Docker Hub) using keyless (OIDC) signing — authenticated via browser, Sigstore issued short-lived cert, signature + Rekor transparency log entry created
- cosign itself warned against signing by tag rather than digest — direct external validation of the project's own "digest, never tag" threat-model decision (STRIDE: tampering)
- Verified both outcomes manually before coding: unsigned image (`argoproj/rollouts-demo:blue`) → clean `no signatures found` error, not a partial/warning state; signed image → full verification including Rekor transparency log check and cert chain validation
- Simplest of the three checks to implement — cosign's own exit code (0/non-zero) directly indicates pass/fail, no need to parse structured output and threshold like Trivy's vulnerability counts

### Note on public transparency log
Keyless signing permanently records the signer's OIDC identity (incl. email) in Rekor's public, immutable log — acceptable/intentional here since this is a public portfolio project, but worth being deliberate about for any real signing identity used in production.

### Milestone: all three checks (Trivy, Kyverno, cosign) working together
First working end-to-end response combining all three, against real signed/unsigned/vulnerable images — confirms analysis-runner's core logic is complete. Verified mixed result: Trivy fail + Kyverno fail + cosign pass → overall_status correctly "fail".

## Session 5 — Containerization, RBAC, in-cluster deployment

### Multi-stage Docker build
- Stage 1 (`golang:1.23-bookworm`): compiles the Go binary
- Stage 2 (`debian:bookworm-slim`): minimal runtime, installs trivy/cosign/kubectl CLIs, copies in ONLY the compiled binary from stage 1 via `COPY --from=builder` — Go compiler/toolchain never present in final image
- Image size: ~475MB (three bundled CLI tools account for most of this)

### Kind image loading
- Kind clusters don't share the host's Docker image cache — `analysis-runner:local` had to be explicitly loaded onto all 3 nodes via `kind load docker-image`
- Deployment uses `imagePullPolicy: Never` since the image only exists locally (not in any registry) — without this, Kubernetes defaults to trying (and failing) to pull from Docker Hub

### RBAC (least-privilege, matches original architecture doc)
- `ServiceAccount` (analysis-runner-sa) + namespace-scoped `Role` (not ClusterRole) + `RoleBinding`, all in `demo` namespace
- Role grants only `get`/`list` on `pods` and `policyreports` (`wgpolicyk8s.io` API group — a CNCF-standard schema, not Kyverno-specific) — no writes, no other resource types, no secrets access
- `serviceAccountName: analysis-runner-sa` in the pod spec is what actually mounts the ServiceAccount's token into the pod, enabling in-cluster API access — this is the concrete mechanism, not just an RBAC concept on paper

### Proof: local vs in-cluster credential behavior
- `docker run` locally (no Kubernetes context at all): Trivy + cosign worked fine (registry access only, no K8s dependency); Kyverno failed cleanly with `connection refused to localhost:8080` — kubectl's default fallback with zero configured access. Clean, honest failure — not a false pass.
- Deployed as a real pod with `analysis-runner-sa`: same Kyverno check now succeeds, using the automatically-mounted ServiceAccount token — no kubeconfig file needed anywhere, this is Kubernetes' standard in-cluster auth mechanism.
- This confirms the whole credential chain end-to-end: RBAC Role → ServiceAccount → mounted token → kubectl automatically uses it → Kyverno check succeeds with least-privilege access only.

### Milestone: analysis-runner fully running inside the cluster
First real, in-cluster (not local dev) execution of all three checks together, using genuine least-privilege RBAC — this is the actual production-shaped version of the service, not a local approximation.

### Repo structure correction
`manifests/` was briefly created inside `services/analysis-runner/` by mistake — moved to project root to match planned structure (`manifests/` = K8s resource definitions, `services/` = application source code, kept separate deliberately).

## Session 6 — End-to-end connection: real AnalysisTemplate → real analysis-runner

### The milestone
Renamed `mock-security-check` → `security-check`, pointed the real AnalysisTemplate at `analysis-runner.demo.svc.cluster.local:8081/check` (jsonPath corrected to `{$.overall_status}`, matching analysis-runner's actual top-level response field, not the mock's flat `status`).

Triggered a real canary rollout (`argoproj/rollouts-demo:yellow`) through the complete real pipeline for the first time:
Rollout → setWeight:20 → real AnalysisRun created → calls real analysis-runner pod → runs real Trivy scan + real Kyverno PolicyReport check + real cosign verify → returns overall_status: fail → Argo Rollouts automatically aborts and rolls back.

Result: `RolloutAborted: Metric "security-check" assessed Failed due to failed (1) > failureLimit (0)`

This is the project's core thesis, proven end-to-end: a canary can be automatically rolled back purely due to a security regression, independent of SLO/performance metrics — closing the exact gap identified in the original problem statement (standard canary tooling gates on performance only, allowing a version with a critical CVE, policy violation, or bad signature straight through to 100%).

### What's now real vs still simulated
- Real: Trivy scan-by-digest, Kyverno live policy check, cosign/Rekor verification, Argo Rollouts canary + AnalysisRun mechanics, RBAC/ServiceAccount-scoped in-cluster execution, automatic rollback on security failure
- Still simulated/manual: image-digest is a hardcoded placeholder (no CI pipeline yet generating it), signing/scanning happens manually rather than as part of a build pipeline, no ArgoCD GitOps sync

## Design note — handling unfixable CVEs (not yet implemented)

### The problem
Fail-closed on any CRITICAL CVE is correct as a default, but some CVEs have no available fix (Trivy `Status: affected`, `fix_deferred`, `will_not_fix` — vs `fixed`, which is genuinely actionable). A gate that blocks forever with no legitimate override doesn't improve security — it trains teams to bypass or disable the gate entirely (worse than no gate, since it creates false confidence that checks are still happening).

### Design: per-deployment allowlist ConfigMap, not a code-level bypass
- Each user/team maintains their own ConfigMap (e.g. `security-gate-allowlist`) listing explicitly accepted CVE IDs, each with a required justification, approver, and expiry/review date
- analysis-runner reads this ConfigMap at check-time; only CRITICAL findings NOT on the (non-expired) allowlist fail the gate
- Response `reason` field must explicitly state which CVEs were found vs. accepted-and-excluded — never silently hidden (same principle as the Kyverno anchor bug: a check that can silently no-op is dangerous even when the underlying decision was reasonable)

### Key guardrail: no auto-acceptance
Trivy's own `Status` field (`fixed` vs `affected`/`fix_deferred`/`will_not_fix`) is used to classify findings automatically — but "no fix available" is never auto-added to the allowlist. `will_not_fix` means "no patch coming," not "safe" — exploitability still requires human judgment (is the vulnerable code path actually reachable in how we use this package?). analysis-runner can generate a ready-to-review candidate allowlist entry (CVE ID, status, pre-filled template) to reduce tedium, but committing it to the allowlist remains a deliberate human action requiring a written justification — never automatic.

### Status: designed, not yet built. Planned for a dedicated session — touches core Trivy evaluation logic in analysis-runner and deserves focused implementation + testing, not a rushed addition.

### Still remaining
- [ ] CI pipeline, ArgoCD GitOps
- [ ] NetworkPolicy, mTLS, tighter RBAC review
- [ ] Grafana dashboard, chaos testing
### Remaining before this is genuinely production-shaped
- [ ] Wire the real AnalysisTemplate (mock-security-check) to point at analysis-runner's actual /check endpoint instead of the mock
- [ ] Replace placeholder image-digest arg with real CI/GitOps-injected value
- [ ] Decide/tune consecutiveErrorLimit etc. against real observed latency of a combined Trivy+Kyverno+cosign call (currently untested — likely several seconds combined, especially Trivy's DB-backed scan)
### Not yet done
- [ ] Containerize analysis-runner (Dockerfile), test running as an actual pod — note: no local Docker socket inside a typical pod, Trivy will need to reach the registry remotely, not rely on local docker/containerd sockets like it did on the Ubuntu host
- [ ] Real RBAC scoping for analysis-runner's ServiceAccount (currently running locally with your own kubectl credentials — full access, not the least-privilege Role from the original architecture doc)
